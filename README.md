## 🧚 Story
This game is based on a webseries, called [Zerberster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGRG39QhbZw&list=PLHMArgH9bh0uq-rIA4Yi-yeLiHL0rg9zT&ab_channel=ThomasHacker).
It's about a dystopian world invaded by unknown alien forces simply known as 'demons'. In the second episode of the series, the protagonist `Jujuman` encounters the survivor `Gunman Jean` (played by Jean-Claude van Damme) who defended his base called `pipe damm`. 

The story of the game picks up right after the attacks by `the` `demons` started and shows `Gunman Jeans` eternal struggle to survive.
